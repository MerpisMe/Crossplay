# Crossplay
Allows crossplay to happen in terraria servers via packet handling and manipulation

## ReceiveBytes
 * This branch will not be in support for long, since it's only meant as a pre-release before the [Pryaxis team](https://github.com/Pryaxis) updates TShock to a newer version.
 * Its highly recommended to use this version for yourself before this happens. It allows for a slightly more stable experience mobile side.

## Building
 * Open visual studio, and build the project (`Shift+F6`)
 * Copy the built plugin into the `ServerPlugins` directory in your TShock folder
 * Replace the `OTAPI` and `TerrariaServer` files with the ones supplied [in the references folder](https://github.com/Moneylover3246/Crossplay/tree/Crossplay-ReceiveBytes/References)
