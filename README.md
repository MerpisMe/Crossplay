# What is Crossplay?
Crossplay allows for cross-platform play between all 1.4.x.x+ versions, utlimately closing the gap between Terraria on mobile and PC devices. This plugin works by modifying incoming packets sent from the client (and outgoing packets sent from the server) to match whatever game protocol the packets are being sent to. 

## Installation
Installation is very easy; Simply insert the plugin file (`Crossplay.dll`) into the `ServerPlugins` folder of your TShock install.
